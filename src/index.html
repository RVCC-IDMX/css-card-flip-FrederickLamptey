        Huray! It is yet another day of thanksgiving. Yes, the year hasn't been all rosy but we are still alive and that's what we should be thankful for. At least when you have life, you have hope for the future. Hence, as we all gather with our loved ones today, lets ensure that we make it memorable one by digesting more turkeys, laughing with loved ones and the greatest of all, showing love to everyone we find around today! Stay safe and blessed in this winter season.
